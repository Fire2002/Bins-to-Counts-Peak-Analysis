# Bins-to-Counts Peak Analysis

In my PY 506 class, I had a project where I studied the radium content of Brazil nuts.

As Brazil nuts are surprisingly known for their highly variable traces of radium (Ra-226), one can
take a NaI(TI) scintillation radiation detector (scintillator) and multichannel analyzer (MCA) to measure the counts versus bins (energy channels) via the emitted gamma radiation.

Attached is a file investigating the peaks in bin 140, 285, and 520 in the data file provided via a function to extract the total number of counts in each peak.
